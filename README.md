# 🧠 AI Misinformation Detector

An AI-powered tool that detects **fake news and misinformation in real time**.
This project analyzes text using AI and provides a **credibility score** to help users identify whether the information is trustworthy or potentially misleading.

TruthGuard-X is a Next.js 16 (App Router) project built with React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, and Framer Motion. It calls the OpenRouter and Groq APIs to perform fact-checking and deepfake analysis for the Indian market ("Bharat Edition").

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Local Development

1. **Clone & Install:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd truthguard-x
   npm install
   ```

2. **Optional: Add OpenRouter API Key** (for AI-powered analysis)
   - Edit `.env.local`:
     ```
     OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-your-key-here
     ```
   - Get a free key from: [https://openrouter.ai/api/keys](https://openrouter.ai/api/keys)
   - **Note:** The app works without a key using local pattern matching

3. **Run Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

4. **Build for Production:**

## 🔐 Security Notes

- **Never commit `.env.local`** - it's in `.gitignore`
- API keys are only loaded on the server (Next.js API routes)
- For Vercel, keys are securely stored in project settings
- Test files use environment variables for security
